Simon Game

Simon Game is a classic memory game that tests your ability to remember and replicate patterns. It challenges your concentration and enhances your memory skills in a fun and interactive way. Inspired by the popular electronic game from the 1970s, Simon Game brings the nostalgia and excitement of the original game to your digital devices.

How to Play
The game starts with a random sequence of colored buttons lighting up and producing corresponding sounds.

Pay close attention to the sequence as you will need to repeat it correctly.

Once the sequence is complete, it's your turn to replicate it. Click or tap the buttons in the same order as the original sequence.

The game progressively becomes more challenging as the sequences get longer and more complex. Stay focused and keep track of the patterns.

Aim to achieve the highest score possible by successfully replicating longer and more intricate sequences.
